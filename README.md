# sign_up_form_TOD
Project: Sign-Up Form | The Odin Project

It's been a while coding in HTML and CSS. Review of basic HTML and CSS syntax, as well as challenging myself with styling a sign-up form from scratch.
Most styling is from scratch, except for a few elements of the submit button.
At this time, no JavaScript is implemented. To be revisited soon.
